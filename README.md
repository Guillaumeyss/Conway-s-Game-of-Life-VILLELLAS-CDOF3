# Conway-s-Game-of-Life-VILLELLAS-CDOF3
This school project implements the Conway's Game of Life on python!

## Principle of the game of life 

The game of life also known simply as Life, is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970.
The game doesn't require any player, this means that it's evolution is determined by the initial settings/state.
To play, you have to create the initial configuration, and then, you only have to sit and watch how it goes.
The game is also Turing complete and can simulate a universal constructor or any other Turing machine.

Here's a gif of a Gosper's glider gun creating gliders :

## This implementation

This project uses python and was written from scratch.

Here's a picture of the game :

You can change the size of the world, as well as change the delay between two frames.

## Run the project

To run the app, you only have to type the following command in the terminal, in the project's folder:
```bash
python main.py
```
