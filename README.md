# Conway-s-Game-of-Life-VILLELLAS-CDOF3
This school project implements the Conway's Game of Life on python!

## Principle of the game of life 

The game of life also known simply as Life, is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970.
The game doesn't require any player, this means that it's evolution is determined by the initial settings/state.
To play, you have to create the initial configuration, and then, you only have to sit and watch how it goes.
The game is also Turing complete and can simulate a universal constructor or any other Turing machine.

## This implementation

This project uses python and the ... library.
